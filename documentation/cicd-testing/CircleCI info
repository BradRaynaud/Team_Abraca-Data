CircleCI is what we will use for our CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.
It is a cloud-based pipeline which means that we don't need a dedicated server to run.
There is also a free plan that works within the resource constraints of our project.

CircleCI has easy integration with docker through its config files.
We will use this link to CircleCI documentation to get started on it for sprint 3:
https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#section=getting-started

For the time being, CircleCI integration into our current forms of testing seems to be adding a few lines of code into our .yaml file.

WE HAVE DECIDED TO NOT PURSUE A CICD PIPELINE FOR THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT
