Something worth considering in terms of hosting:

Amazon now offers SSL certifications for any websites using AWS for their hosting.
What this means for us is that:
	- if we are to go to a cloud provider, we will most likely use AWS
	- the SSL certificate acquisition process will be substantially easier
	- hosting might be slightly more expensive than initially thought

Kyle will do more research as to what kind of resources will need to be rented.
This will give more insight as to the capabilities of the hosting as well as the pricing.
