We have decided to go with a DigitalOcean droplet for our hosting.

DigitalOcean is a cloud service that we can use to host our website for 24/7 access.

All that needs to happen is one person has an account and configures hosting as well as SSL certificate acquisition.
The process should take no longer than a few hours and is the final thing we do in terms of deploying the project.




ALL DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE IS OUTDATED======================================================

Something worth considering in terms of hosting:

Amazon now offers SSL certifications for any websites using AWS for their hosting.
What this means for us is that:
	- if we are to go to a cloud provider, we will most likely use AWS
	- the SSL certificate acquisition process will be substantially easier
	- hosting might be slightly more expensive than initially thought

Kyle will do more research as to what kind of resources will need to be rented.
This will give more insight as to the capabilities of the hosting as well as the pricing.
